# Translatable
My first portfolio project, Translatable, an app designed to transcribe English and translate it to the desired language.

First commit - styled the page and created a listening state. Added a little functionality to it and some animations to the button when listening.

Second commit - added speech recognition with Web Speech API. Implemented useEffect to store speech in a transcript variable, which gets rendered into the output container.

Third commit - added a translation API using openAI.

Fourth commit - Show transcription and translation in the output container after translation. Also added loading spinners for when the user is recording and when message is translating
